# JavaAdv-Assignment 3

The final assignment of the course 'EC advanced Java'.

The main focus is to show that you know how to work with\
STREAMS, THREADS, SERIALIZATION and OBJECT MANAGEMENT with several classes.\
The game itself is NOT the important part.

Function of the game is that you're stuck inside a basement of fours rooms,\
with three NPC's. They move around, pick up and drop stuff.\
You need to get out by finding a key that's hidden somewhere.

-->> Spoiler! <<--\
Don't read this unless you want to know how to finish the game quickly.
1. Get to the last room, pick up the only items available on room floors at the start(some bread), unless NPC's dropped something that is.
2. Trade it with Jason's 'Normal key'.
3. Open the chest in the first room with the key.
4. Use the contents of the chest to exit through the door at the last room.
