# JavaAdv-Assignment 3

Last assignment on the course 'EC advanced Java'.
Focus is to show that you know STREAMS, THREADS, SERIALIZATION and OBJECT MANAGEMENT with several classes.
The game itself is NOT the important part.

Function of the game is that you're stuck inside a baseement of fours rooms,
with three NPC's, were two of them are moving around and picking and dropping stuff.
You need to get out by finding a key that's hidden somewhere.

Spoiler! 
Don't read this unless you want to know how to finish the game quickly.
1. Get to the last room, pick up the only items available on room floors at the start(some bread), unless NPC's dropped something that is.
2. Trade it with Jason's 'Normal key'.
3. Open the chest in the first room with the key.
4. Use the contents of the chest to exit through the door at the last room.
